## Why I have so many errors
Hey, don't worry, We will fix this (or at least I hope so)

1. Check if you have [VS Code Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
2. Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Deno: Enable`
3. Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Deno: Cache Dependencies`

if above steps didn't fix your errors, then I have some bad news for you...
